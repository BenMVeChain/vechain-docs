# Acquire Vechain Assets

## How do I buy VET & VTHO?&#x20;

Currently, the simplest way to purchase VET and/or VTHO with fiat currency, is through a centralised exchange (CEX). Vechain's tokens are available to purchase on multiple notable centralised exchanges including Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com. A CEX acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Each CEX has its own sign up process but generally, in order to purchase VET/VTHO a user will:

* Create an account
* Complete the KYC process
* Enable 2FA
* Deposit fiat funds via bank transfers or credit card payment.&#x20;
* Choose the cryptocurrency to buy - VET or VTHO.
* Place a buy order.
* Withdraw funds to a personal wallet.

Always double check and confirm the CEX website address to ensure you are using the official website.&#x20;

## Should I withdraw my VET & VTHO from a CEX?&#x20;

There is a well-known saying within the blockchain industry that was popularized by Andreas Antonopoulos: "Not your keys, not your bitcoin". Although Andreas referenced bitcoin, this saying is true for any cryptocurrency.&#x20;

What does he mean by the saying? Essentially, as long as you do not own and manage the private keys that control your crytocurrency, you are exposed to counterparty risk. By entrusting a third party to manage your cryptocurrency, a CEX, you trust they will secure your cryptocurrency effectively while also act in good faith and not using your cryptocurrency for their own gain.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Vechain nor any of it's affliates will ever request you to share your private key.\

Never share your private key, this will most likely result in a loss of assets.
