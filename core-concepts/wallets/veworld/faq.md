# FAQ

## Can I buy tokens directly on VeWorld?
While you can't buy directly on VeWorld, we do have third-party purchasing options integrated in the app. You can do this by selecting the Buy button on your home page. This will take you to another screen that will show you options for purchasing.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you experience any issues with transactions when purchasing, please reach out directly to the provider you used.
{% endhint %}

## I have multiple wallets on one device, how do I switch between them?
There are two ways. The easiest is to go to the wallet icon (iOS/Android) or three vertical dots (Chrome) in the top right corner. On the mobile app this will bring you straight to your wallet list, on the Chrome Extension you need to then select 'Manage Wallets'. The other method is to go to settings (Gear icon in the bottom right) and select 'Manage Wallets' from here.

## How can I send tokens?
You can do this by selecting 'Send' on the home page, then selecting which token you wish to send on the next page. Once this is selected, input the address or VET Domain and the amount you wish to send. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Always take extra care when sending tokens and ensure the address you're sending to is correct. Transactions on the blockchain are permanent and coins sent to the wrong address cannot be recovered.
{% endhint %}

## FantasHow can I add or remove tokens from my home page?
On the mobile app, tap the pen icon next to "Your Tokens" on the homepage. Scroll through or search for tokens and tap the one you want to add. To remove tokens, simply tap them again.

On the browser extension, go to the homepage and scroll down to "Manage Tokens." Click it, then use the search box to find or browse tokens. Click the token you want to add. To remove tokens, click the bin icon next to the token you want to delete.

## My wallet says 'Test Net' and my tokens are gone, how do I get them back?
Your tokens aren't gone, however Test Net is a different network used to test new products or features. Most recently this was used in the test phase of VeBetterDAO. If you linked your wallet to this app, you may have been switched to Test Net unknowingly.

To get back onto Main Net, go to Settings in the bottom right corner then select Networks. You will see an option here to select a network, click into this and select Main Net. Once you go back to the homepage, you'll see your tokens again.

## I reinstalled VeWorld and my wallets are gone, what happened?
If you have reinstalled VeWorld on the same device or a new device you will need to set up a wallet password again and import your wallets using either your Seed Phrase, Private Key, Keystore or Ledger.
