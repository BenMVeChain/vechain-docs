# Introduction to blockchain

## What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that securely records transactions across a network of computers. It maintains data in a series of interconnected blocks, ensuring transparency, immutability, and decentralization.

## How does a blockchain work?

Blockchains consist of cryptographically linked blocks, each containing a set of transactions and a unique identifier called a "hash." Network participants validate new blocks using consensus algorithms, ensuring data integrity. Once verified, blocks are permanently added to the chain, creating an unalterable record.

## What are blockchains used for?

Blockchain technology has diverse applications across industries due to its decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Current use cases include cryptocurrencies, digital assets, identity management, supply chain tracking, and secure voting systems. As the technology evolves, we anticipate more innovative applications to emerge.

## Who operates the blockchain?

Blockchains operate on a peer-to-peer network without central authority. Instead, a distributed network of users collectively maintains and validates the blockchain, ensuring its integrity and functionality through consensus mechanisms.

## Why do we need blockchains?

Blockchain technology offers several advantages over traditional centralized systems:

* **Decentralization**: Eliminates single points of failure, enhancing security and resilience.
* **Transparency**: Provides a public, verifiable ledger of all transactions.
* **Immutability**: Ensures data integrity by making recorded information tamper-resistant.
* **Security**: Utilizes advanced cryptography to protect transactions and data.
* **Efficiency**: Streamlines processes by reducing intermediaries and automating trust.

These features make blockchain a powerful tool for creating more secure, transparent, and efficient systems across various sectors.
