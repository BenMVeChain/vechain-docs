# Read From Smart Contracts

The information stored on the Blockchain can be accessed through three distinct methods:

1. States & Views refer to variables and functions that are publicly accessible from a contract.
2. Events are messages generated by contracts to record data.
3. Storage slots offer raw access to the data stored within contracts.
