# Remix

[Remix](https://remix-project.org/) is a comprehensive, web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for smart contract creation and deployment. It caters to developers of all skill levels, serving as both a powerful toolset for the entire contract development lifecycle and an educational platform for learning and experimenting with Ethereum-based technologies.

Our VeChain integration with Remix enables our community to leverage this robust IDE when developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the VeChain blockchain. By providing an RPC proxy, we've made it possible for VeChain developers to seamlessly use Remix's feature-rich environment while targeting the VeChain network, combining the familiarity of Ethereum development tools with the unique advantages of the VeChain ecosystem.
