# VeChain & Remix

The Remix Project is a rich toolset for developing that can be used for the entire journey of contract development by users of any knowledge level, and as a learning lab for teaching and experimenting with Ethereum.

Our Remix plugin allows our VeChain community to use Remix when developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on VeChain.
